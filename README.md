# Machine Learning Projects



## Description

This a collection of inductory machine learning projects intended to be a demonstartion of how to make use some of the most common data sets are available to a beginner in data science and machine learning.

## Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
This dataset is a binary classification problem. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
